Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

              <h3>Research</h3>
              <p>Conduct research about the person you will be interviewing as well as the specific topic you will be asking questions about, if applicable. Look up as much relevant information about the person as you can, and try to find some recordings of in person interviews with that person if possible. This will help you have a sense of the person's personality and interview style, and to adjust your interview accordingly.</p>

              <h3>Clarify your objective</h3>
              <p>Before you prepare your interview questions, you should understand your objective for interviewing the person. Is it simply to give readers more insight into that person's personal life, to discuss one aspect of that person's career, or to discuss that person's perspective on a certain political situation? Whatever your objective, your questions should help you meet your objectives.</p>

          <h3> Prepare Questions</h3>
            <aside>
              <p>You should prepare questions that are flexible, open-ended, and which all come equipped with at least two or three follow-up questions that you can ask depending on the answer to the original question. Here are a few general rules for preparing questions for an interview:
                <ul class="list of items">
                  <li> Don't ask any "yes" or "no" questions or questions that can be answered in just a few words.</li>
                  <li> Ask questions that allow the person you're interviewing to expand. </li>
                  <li> Ask just one question at a time. Asking more than one at a time will overwhelm your interviewee. </li>
                  <li> Ask questions that are relevant to your objectives. This is an important point. You can make them creative as long as they meet your needs.</li>
                  <li> Don't ask questions that are so broad that your subject doesn't know how to answer them. Your subject should be directed enough to know what type of an answer you're looking for. </li>
                </ul>
              </aside>

            <div class="content">
              <h3>Check your recording equipment.</h3>
              <p>If you're using a recorder, make sure it works and has fresh batteries before the day of the interview. You don't want your interview to be doomed before it starts.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <h3>Introduce yourself.</h3>
              <p>Have warm and open body language as you shake hands with the person and introduce yourself. Tell the person a bit about yourself and show that you're just a regular person instead of an intimidating interviewer. Tell the person whatever will help him understand who you are and why you're conducting the interview.
After you introduce yourself, you can say a bit about how the interview will go -- say how long it will be, if there will be time for more casual conversation at the end, or anything else the subject will need to know beforehand.</p>

              <h3>Make the person comfortable.</h3>
              <p>This is the most important thing you can do before you officially give the interview. After you've introduced yourself, you can make the person comfortable with some small talk, some light jokes, and by making eye contact and using your hands to gesture or keeping them at your sides. Keep your body open and posed toward that person without invading his personal space.</p>

               <li>Before you even start the interview, thank the person for taking the time to meet with you.</li>
               <li>If you're at the person's home or office, look around the room for some objects that are displayed. The person put them up because he's proud of them, so ask some basic questions to make the person open up.</li>
               <li>If the person is meeting you in your home or office or even a coffee shop, make sure the environment is comfortable by providing comfortable seating, relative privacy, and some tea, coffee, or snacks if you can. Make the person feel at home.</li>

              <h3>Ask your questions.</h3>
              <p>Maintain eye contact as you ask the question and listen intently to the answer. Don't say, "My first question is..." or "My next question is..." Make the person feel like you're just having a natural conversation, not firing questions at him like a detective.
Always start out with questions that understand who the person is, understanding what they want, understand what the challenges are they're facing, and what the path is they want to take so that you can help them achieve those goals.</p>

              <p>Don't say "Uh huh," every two seconds in an exaggerated manner. Just nod intently from time to time and really focus on what the person is saying at that moment instead of thinking about his previous response or about the next question. If your mind wanders, the person you're interviewing will be able to tell right away.</p>
